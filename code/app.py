Spots develop on the leaves until the leaves become deformed. Edges on leaves generally appears blistered and scaly with the border between healthy and diseased leaf tissue clearly visible. Some infected fruit is so damaged that it falls from the branch before the fruit ripens.",
    "Cedar Apple Rust": "Cedar apple rust, or CAR, is a strange fungal disease that affects apple and red cedar trees. This disease can quickly destroy apple trees and causes spots on the fruit. First appears on the foliage as small greenish-yellow spots that gradually enlarge, becoming orange-yellow to rust-colored with red ribbon. The undersides of the leaves begin to form lesions that produce spores.",
    "Black Rot": "The spread of black rot disease is caused by the fungus Gloeosporium sp and can be through air, water splashes and contaminated agricultural tools. Humidity factors and the lack of sunlight entering the plants cause fungi to grow quickly, especially during the rainy season like this. Over time, the spots widen and heavily infected leaves fall from the tree. Branches with black rot may infect other parts of the plant."
